Multiple papers on PU.1 LoF/GoF find varied phenotypes. With LoF, GM progenitors can be generated but are only able to proliferate and cannot differentiate. Low dosage may increase the amount of granulocytes. The number of mk-erythrocyte progenitors is either normal or increased. Multiple pathways of DC production are impaired. One of the refs is from 27 years ago and uses the term “myeloid” in a way that seems crucially inconsistent with its 2025 meaning, so I hesitate to interpret those results.
